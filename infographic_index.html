      <p><span>D</span>-mannose is a sugar related to glucose naturally found in cranberries and blueberries. You need a concentrated dose, which you can find in powder or capsules. D-mannose has bacterial anti-adhesion properties, which means it attaches to E. coli and then passes out of the body, taking the bacteria with it. </p>
      <p>Recommended dosages are 1000-15000mg 1-3 times per day. Continue to take until at least one day after symptoms subside. </p>
